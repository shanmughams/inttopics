3. TinyURL URL Shortner System Design
- NFR :
	1 - High Availability
	2 - Low Latency
	
- FR :
	- Get Short URL
	- Redirect to long URL
	
- Clarifications
	1 - Length if tiny URL
	2 - Traffic looking it	= No of url x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 = Y (unique requests / year)
	3 - character set allowed for short url 
		 [a-z], [A-z][0-9] => 62 diff chars
		- for one char lenght of tiny url , with 62 diff chars - we can generate 62 urls,
		for 2 chars comibination, its 62 power 2
		for 8 chars, its 62 power of  8
		- fix the power value, so that it would match the traffic value appropriately
		i.e 62 power n > Y. N = log 62 Y
		62 power 6 -> 58 billinon
		62 power 7 -> 3.2 trillion 
		General ppl choose 7
		log62(14776336) = 4
		62 power of 4 = 14776336
		
	3 - How long to persist the saved url
	4 - Potential to growth of URLs
	
	Design Aspects
		- Microservices to provide short url generation service
		- How to avoid collision beween same URL bening generated by 2 services?
			- use redis cluster 
		- Avoid SPO failure
