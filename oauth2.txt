Four basic roles in OAuth2
=========================
	- Resource owner 
		- the owner of the resource - this is pretty self-explanatory :-)
	- Resource server 
		- the server hosting all the protected resources
	- Client 
		- the application accessing the resource server
	- Authorization server 
		- the server that handles issuing access tokens to clients. This could be the same server as the resource server

	
Two types of tokens
===================
	- Access token
		- Limited lifetime and enables the client to access protected resources by including this token in the request header
	- Refresh token
		- With longer lifetime used to get a new access token once it expires (without the need of sending credentials to the server again)
