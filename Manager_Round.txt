Keep the Amazon Leadership Principles in mind

At Amazon, the Leadership Principles are used by Amazonians every day, “whether they’re discussing ideas for new projects, deciding on the best solution for a customer’s problem, or interviewing candidates.” When answering behavioural questions, try to tie in your answers to one of the fourteen principles: 

1 - Customer Obsession, 
2 - Ownership, 
3 - Invent and Simplify,
4 - Leaders Are Right (A Lot),
5 - Learn and Be Curious,
6 - Hire and Develop the Best, 
7 - Insist on the Highest Standards, 
8 - Think Big, 
9 - Bias for Action, 
10 - Frugality, 
11 - Earn Trust, 
12 - Dive Deep, 
13 - Have Backbone (Disagree and Commit), 
14 - Deliver Results.

Use stories to answer behavioural questions

Behavioural questions aren't yes or no questions, so you need to spin a story around them – a story about something that happened at work and shows the skills you’re being asked about. Michael Higgins, career coach at This is My Path and author of Pit Stop: A Career Workbook for Busy People, advocates using the STAR technique to “structure your stories”. He suggests how to structure your response to a “Tell me a time…” question: Speak about the “Situation (set the context for your story), Task (what was required of you), Activity (what you actually did) and Result (how well the situation played out).” It's important to speak in specific rather than general terms and quantify your success - so bring in numbers, names, client conversions and other things that matter. It would be best to prepare two stories for every leadership principle – this will ensure that you are covered if they ask you for another example. You don’t want just one example that shows how “you could have stopped working, but persisted.”

================================================

1. Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

• Who was your most difficult customer?

• Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?

• When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

• Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.

 

2. Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.

• Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.

• Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.

 

3. Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

• Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

• Tell me about a time when you invented something.

 

4. Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

• Tell me about a time when you were wrong.

• Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

 

5. Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

• Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions.

• Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.

 

6. Hire and Develop The Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and will move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

• Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

 

7. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

• Tell me about a time when you couldn’t meet your own expectations on a project.

• Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.

 

8. Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

• Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.

• Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.

 

9. Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.  

• Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.

• Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.

• Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

 

10. Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.  There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

• Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.

 

11. Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

• What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing?

• Tell me about a time when you had to tell someone a harsh truth.

 

12. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

• Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.

 

13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

• Tell me about a time when you did not accept the status quo.

• Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours.

• Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team members approach.

• If your direct manager was instructing you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it?

 

14. Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

• By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments. Describe the results.

• What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?

• Give me an example of a time when you were 75% of the way through a project, and you had to pivot strategy–how were you able to make that into a success story?

	It is possible to keep scope, resources &amp; timeline (dates) unchanged, but compromise on quality. This will impact team retention, especially the stronger engineers on the team, over the longer run.

	The leadership team must understand the consequences.

	The feasibility which could lead to happen this type of situations is due to critical business needs. It means senior management would be actively involved and here agile framework will come into play. Delivering the workable product and then further developing the solution would be the best possible shot for win win situation.
