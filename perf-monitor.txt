Top 10 reasons why your Enterprise Java Application is slow
=====================

1. There is a sudden spike in the ‘Load’ that you did not notice
	- monitor the ‘throughput’ of the application (specifically, number of requests/minute). 
2. There is a poorly responding backend system i.e webservices or remote Msg Queues
	- Monitor the response time of the external systems experienced by your application
3. Your database calls are taking for ever
	- Running OUT System resources such as CPU, Memory
	- A Block in the Database
4. You are running out Database connections i.e When you max out the DB Connection Pool
	- It could be that you are NOT closing the DB connections properly.
5. You are running out of Threads
	- When you exhaust all the available threads in the Thread pool, subsequent requests go into ‘wait’ state, waiting for an available thread – painful wait time. The reason why you are running of out thread should be investigated. It could be because of a poorly performing backend or a slow DB response time.
6. The Server hosting your application is running slow or running out of resources
	- Tools like Nagios can help monitor the infrastructure effectively.
7. Super excessive logging in your Application
